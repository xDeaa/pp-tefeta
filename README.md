## <a name='overview'>🦊 Rules</a>

Hi, here are some rules to carry out this story oav;

* You **MUST** create a git repository named `pp-tefeta`
* You **MUST** create a file called `.author.json` with your fullname

```sh
~/ts-baratie ❯❯❯ cat -e .author.json
{
  "fullname" : "John H. Conway"
}$
```

> Of course, you can talk about the subject with other developers, peer-learning is
> the key to be a better developer. Don't hesitate to ask questions or help people on slack.

> Don't forget, there is no useless question :-)

* You **MUST** return the project on Monday May, 18 at 12:00 pm by sending an MP on slack with the link of your github repo.

Your repository **MUST** contain the totality of your source files, but no useless files (node_modules, temp files, log files,...).

## <a name='overview'>🐱 Overview</a>

The purpose of this project is simple, you **MUST** create a binary or a script that take any textual map file that represent a labyrinth and you have to output the labyrinth with a trace of the labyrinth solution.

### = Prelude

As a programming pragmatic module, you **CAN** use the programming language you want/love.<br />
The only thing is that you must provide a **Dockerfile** that run your project ;)

### = Map

A mapfile is a simple ascii file that contain on the first line the dimension of the map and then the labyrinth.<br />
The number 1 refer to the **entry** and the number 2 to the **exit**

Example:
```sh
$ cat -e ./data/maps/rect.01.map
13x12$
*************$
*  **       1$
*     *******$
*        ****$
**          *$
*     **** **$
********** **$
*           *$
*    ********$
*        *  *$
********    *$
*********2***$
```
